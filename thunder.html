    <h2>Thunder</h2>
    <pre>
        Just a young gun with a quick fuse
        I was uptight, wanna let loose
        I was dreaming of bigger things and
        Wanna leave my own life behind
        Not a yessir. not a follower
        Fit the box, fit the mold
        Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
        I was lighting before the thunder
        
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder
        Thunder. thunder
        Thunder
        
        Kids were laughing in my classes
        While I was scheming for the masses
        Who do you think you are
        Dreaming 'bout being a big star
        They say you're basic, thry say you're easy
        You're always riding in the backseat
        Now I'm smiling from the stage
        While you were clapping in the nose bleeds
        
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder
        Thunder. thunder
        
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder, thunder
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder, thunder
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder, thunder
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder, thunder
        Thunder, feel the thunder
        Lighting then the thunder, thunder
