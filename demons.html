    <h2>Demons</h2>
    <pre>
        When the days are cold
        And the cards all fold
        And the saints we see
        Are all made of gold
        
        When your dreams all fail
        And the ones we hail
        Are the worst of all
        And the blood's run stale
        
        I wanna hide the truth
        I wanna shelter you
        But with the beast inside
        There's nowhere we can hide
        
        No matter what we breed
        We still are made of greed
        This is my kingdom come
        This is my kingdom come
        
        <span class="highlight">When you feel my heat
        Look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        Don't get too close
        It's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide</span>
        
        At the curtain's call
        It's the last of all
        When the lights fade out
        All the sinners crawl
        
        So they dug your grave
        And the masquerade
        Will come calling out
        At the mess you made
        
        Don't wanna let you down
        But I am hell bound
        Though this is all for you
        Don't wanna hide the truth
        
        No matter what we breed
        We still are made of greed
        This is my kingdom come
        This is my kingdom come
        
        <span class="highlight">When you feel my heat
        Look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        Don't get too close
        It's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide</span>
        
        They say it's what you make
        I say it's up to fate
        It's woven in my soul
        I need to let you go
        
        Your eyes, they shine so bright
        I wanna save that light
        I can't escape this now
        Unless you show me how
        
        <span class="highlight">When you feel my heat
        Look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        Don't get too close
        It's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide</span>
