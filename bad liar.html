        Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
        And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
        Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
        It’s been a loveless year
        I'm a man of three fears
        Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
        Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
        
        So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
        Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
        I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
        Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe
        
        <span class="highlight">But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, now you know
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, you’re free to go</span>
        
        Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
        Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
        Oh, I’ve been askin' for
        Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
        I wage my war, on the world inside
        I take my gun to the enemy's side
        Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
        Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems
        
        So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
        Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
        I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
        Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe
        
        <span class="highlight">But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, now you know
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, you're free to go</span>
        
        I can't breathe, I can't be
        I can't be what you want me to be
        Believe me, this one time
        Believe me
        
        <span class="highlight">I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, now you know
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, you're free to go</span>
        
        Oh-oh-oh
        Please believe me
        Please believe me
