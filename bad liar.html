    <pre class="lyrics">
        Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
        And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
        Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
        It’s been a loveless year
        I'm a man of three fears
        Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
        Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
        
        <span class="highlight">So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
        Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
        I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
        Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe</span>
        
        <span class="highlight">But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, now you know
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
       Now you know, you’re free to go</span>
        
        Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
        Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
        Oh, I’ve been askin' for
        Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
        I wage my war, on the world inside
        I take my gun to the enemy's side
        Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
        Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems
        
        <span class="highlight">So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
        Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
        I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
        Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe</span>
            
        <span class="highlight">But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, now you know
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, you’re free to go</span>
        
        I can't breathe, I can't be
        I can't be what you want me to be
        Believe me, this one time
        Believe me
        
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, now you know
        I'm a bad liar, bad liar
        Now you know, you're free to go
        
        Oh-oh-oh
        Please believe me
        Please believe me
