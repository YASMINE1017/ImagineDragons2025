        <p>I wake up to the sounds</p>
        <p>Of the silence that allows</p>
        <p>For my mind to run around</p>
        <p>With my ear up to the ground</p>

        <p>I'm searching to behold</p>
        <p>The stories that are told</p>
        <p>When my back is to the world</p>
        <p>That was smiling when I turned</p>

        <p>Tell you you're the greatest</p>
        <p>But once you turn, they hate us</p>

        <p>Your words up on the wall</p>
        <p>As you're praying for my fall</p>
        <p>And the laughter in the halls</p>
        <p>And the names that I've been called</p>

        <p>I stack it in my mind</p>
        <p>And I'm waiting for the time</p>
        <p>When I show you what it's like</p>
        <p>To be words spit in a mic</p>

        <p>Tell you, you're the greatest</p>
        <p>But once you turn they hate us</p>

        <p>I'm hoping that somebody pray for me</p>
        <p>I'm praying that somebody hope for me</p>
        <p>I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be</p>
        <p>P-P-Posted</p>
        <p>Being a wreck of emotions</p>
        <p>Ready to go whenever, just let me know</p>
        <p>The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor</p>
        <p>The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable</p>
        <p>I'ma tell 'em hasta luego</p>
        <p>They wanna plot on my trot to the top</p>
        <p>I've been outta shape</p>
        <p>Thinkin' out the box</p>
        <p>I'm an astronaut</p>
        <p>I blasted off the planet rock</p>
        <p>To cause catastrophe</p>
        <p>And it matters more because I had it not</p>
        <p>Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition</p>
        <p>Kinda shocking they wanted static</p>
        <p>With precision, I'm automatic, quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking</p>
        <p>Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic</p>
        <p>Batter, batter up</p>
        <p>Who the baddest</p>
        <p>It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat</p>

        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>Spare the sympathy</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be</p>

        <p>Everybody wants to be</p>
        <p>My enemy</p>
        <p>(Pray it away, I swear)</p>
        <p>(I'll never be a saint, no way)</p>
