    <h2>Wake up</h2>
    <pre>
        Wheels up,
        When I’m off the ground
        I’m nowhere
        But I’m all around
        I’m spinning’
        Watch me now
        I’m spinning spinning
        Big man when a wall’s between us
        Big man gonna break to pieces
        Spinning can’t believe it
        Spinning spinning
        Uh,turn around
        Turn it up,Talk a bit
        Zip it up,Lock you in
        And close it up
        Everybody’s coming for you
        Wake up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        Bodies dropping everywhere
        I’m waist up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        
        Some days I’m a chameleon
        Switch it up when I crawl the ceiling
        Flip it upside down I’m wheelin,
        Dealin
        Every single one of you
        Is coming to my mind
        Bring them all together
        Can you stack them in a line?
        Jealousy is gonna be your failure
        Not mine
        Winnin winnin
        Uh,turn around
        Turn it up,Talk a bit
        Zip it up,Lock you in
        And close it up
        Oh!
        Everybody’s coming for you
        Wake up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        Bodies dropping everywhere
        I’m waist up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        
        Got a case of the take or leave it
        Give an inch and I’m bound to seize it
        Take a chainsaw out and feed it
        Come alive when you don’t believe it
        Write me up and I’d love to read it
        Spit your words and I’ll watch you eat it
        Diggin diggin
        Oh!
        Everybody’s coming for you
        Wake up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        Bodies dropping everywhere
        I’m waist up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        Everybody’s coming wake up
        
        What are you to do
        When they come for you
        Winner’s hate to lose
