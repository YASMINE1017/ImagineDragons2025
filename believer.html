            First things first
            I'ma say all the words inside my head
            I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
            The way that things have been, oh-ooh
            Second thing second
            Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
            I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
            The master of my sea, oh-ooh
            
            I was broken from a young age
            Taking my sulking to the masses
            Write down my poems for the few
            That looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
            Singing from heart ache from the pain
            Take up my message from the veins
            Speaking my lesson from the brain
            Seeing the beauty through the
            
            <span class="highlight">Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
            Pain!
            You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
            Pain!
            I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from
            Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</span>
            
            Third things third
            Send a prayer to the ones up above
            All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
            Your spirit up above, oh-ooh
            
            I was choking in the crowd
            Living my brain up in the cloud
            Falling like ashes to the ground
            Hoping my feelings, they would drown
            But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
            Inhibited, limited
            Till it broke up and it rained down
            It rained down, like
            
            <span class="highlight">Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
            Pain!
            You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
            Pain!
            I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from
            Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</span>
            
            Last things last
            By the grace of the fire and the flames
            You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
            The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
            But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
            Inhibited, limited
            Till it broke up and it rained down
            It rained down, like
            
            <span class="highlight">Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
            Pain!
            You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
            Pain!
            I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from
            Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</span>
