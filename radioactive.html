    <h2>Radioactive</h2>
    <pre>
        I'm waking up to ash and dust
        I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
        I'm breathing in the chemicals
        
        I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
        This is it, the apocalypse
        Whoa
        
        I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
        Enough to make my systems blow
        Welcome to the new age, to the new age
        Welcome to the new age, to the new age
        Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
        Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
        
        I raise my flags, don my clothes
        It's a revolution, I suppose
        We're painted red to fit right in
        Whoa
        
        I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
        This is it, the apocalypse
        Whoa
        
        I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
        Enough to make my systems blow
        Welcome to the new age, to the new age
        Welcome to the new age, to the new age
        Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
        Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
        
        All systems go, the sun hasn't died
        Deep in my bones, straight from inside
        
        I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
        Enough to make my systems blow
        Welcome to the new age, to the new age
        Welcome to the new age, to the new age
        Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
        Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
