    <h2>Bones</h2>
    <pre>
        Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
        I'm in the bathroom looking at me
        Face in the mirror is all I need
        Wait until the reaper takes my life
        Never gonna get me out alive
        I will live a thousand million lives
        
        My patience is waning
        Is this entertaining?
        My patience is waning
        Is this entertaining?
        
        I got this feeling, yeah, you know
        Where I'm losing all control
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        I got this feeling in my soul
        Go ahead and throw your stones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        
        Playing with a stick of dynamite
        There was never grey in black and white
        There was never wrong till there was right
        Feeling like a boulder hurdling
        Seeing all the vultures circling
        Burning in the flames I'm working in
        Turning in a bed that's darkening
        
        My patience is waning
        Is this entertaining?
        My patience is waning
        Is this entertaining?
        
        I got this feeling, yeah, you know
        Where I'm losing all control
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        I got this feeling in my soul
        Go ahead and throw your stones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        
        Look in the mirror of my mind
        Turning the pages of my life
        Walking the path so many paced a million times
        Drown out the voices in the air
        Leaving the ones that never cared
        Picking the pieces up and building to the sky
        
        My patience is waning
        Is this entertaining?
        My patience is waning
        Is this entertaining?
        
        I got this feeling yeah you know
        Where I'm losing all control
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        I got this feeling in my soul
        Go ahead and throw your stones
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
        
        There goes my mind
        Don't mind
        There goes my mind
        There goes my mind
        Don't mind
        There goes my mind
        'Cause there's magic in my bones
